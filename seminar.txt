Addressing security challenges in a virtualized environment


Security challenges in a virtualized environment:

    1. Covert channel attacks on x86 virtualized systems[1]
    2. Buffer overflows
    3. VM image pollution
    4. CPU-level computation is not encrypted[2]
    5. Updates not applied to the virtual machine[9]
    6. Network security and privacy[7]
    7. Untrusted virtualization provider[6]
    8. Untrusted virtualized OS[6]
    9. Availability of VMs
    10. Negative externalities[10]


Security solutions in a virtualized environment:

    1. Covert channels are impractical, as the capacity was thought to be less than 2b/s[1]
    2. Data encryption
        2.1 Microsoft BitLocker in software using TPM[4]
        2.2 Vmware hardening guide[5][6]
    3. Homomophically encrypted one instruction computation[2]
    4. VLANs, VXLANs, (NV)GRE network partitioning solutions[5]
    5. Memory hardening, hypervisor lockdown mode[5]
    6. Nested virtual machines(nested process level virtual machines)[8]
    7. Software Update as a Service[9]
    8. Security-aware Virtual Machine Allocation[10]


For every security challenge,there will be presented the threat level(if found)
For every solution, there will be presented the downsides and performance costs.
